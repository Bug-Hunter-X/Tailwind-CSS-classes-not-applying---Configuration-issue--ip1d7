# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply despite what seems like a correctly configured `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem

The provided `index.html` uses the `bg-gray-200` class to set a gray background. However, the background remains white, indicating Tailwind classes are not being applied correctly.  This often stems from a mismatch between the content specified in `tailwind.config.js` and the actual location of your HTML or CSS files.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing your `tailwind.config.js` to ensure the `content` array accurately points to the files where your Tailwind classes are used. It might also involve checking for typos in the class names and correctly running the build process if necessary.
